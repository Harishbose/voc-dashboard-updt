# GitHub Secrets Configuration Guide
# Do NOT add real secrets to this file or any code files

# For GitHub Actions, use Repository Secrets:
# 1. Go to: https://github.com/Harishbose/voc-dashboard-updt/settings/secrets/actions
# 2. Click "New repository secret"
# 3. Add any secrets you need

# The following secrets are automatically available in GitHub Actions:
# - GITHUB_TOKEN: Automatically provided by GitHub (no setup needed)

# No other secrets are currently required for the automated pipeline.
# The workflow uses GITHUB_TOKEN for pushing changes, which GitHub provides automatically.
